# RowanSample8

A collection of Rowan scripts in the scripts directory that create Rowan projects ... this is a way to be able to excercise the scripts and view the projects on disk, without having to create a bunch of separate projects ... Of course at this point in time, the scripting api is still in flux as is the disk format.
